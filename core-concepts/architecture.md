## **1. Introduction to Node.js Architecture**

1. Node.js follows an **event-driven, non-blocking architecture**, making it highly efficient for handling multiple tasks without waiting for one to complete.&#x20;
2. This is achieved using **the Event Loop**, which continuously checks for pending tasks and executes them asynchronously.

***

## **2. Key Components of Node.js Architecture**

### **Call Stack**

* The Call Stack is where **synchronous** functions are executed.
* It follows **Last In, First Out (LIFO)**‚Äîthe last function added is executed first.
* If a function takes time, it **blocks** execution unless handled asynchronously.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
greet();
console.log("This runs after greet()");
```

#### **Output:**

```
Hello, World!
This runs after greet()
```

***

### **Node.js APIs & Background Tasks**

* Some functions (like reading files or making API requests) are sent to the **background** so they don‚Äôt block the main thread.
* These tasks are handled by **Node.js APIs**, allowing other code to continue running.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
fs.readFile("file.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
    console.log("File Read Complete");
});
console.log("Reading File...");
```

#### **Output:**

```
Reading File...
File Read Complete
```

The file read happens in the **background**, so "Reading File..." is printed first.

***

### **Event Loop**

* The **heart of Node.js**, which checks if the **Call Stack is empty** and moves tasks from the **Callback Queue**.
* It ensures that **non-blocking** tasks run efficiently.

***

### **Callback Queue**

* Stores **asynchronous callbacks** waiting to be executed.
* The **Event Loop** moves these tasks to the Call Stack when it is empty.

***

### **Microtask Queue (Promise Queue)**

* Contains **Promises and process.nextTick()** callbacks.
* **Higher priority than the Callback Queue**.
* Executes **before** setTimeout and other async functions.

#### **Example:**

```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log("setTimeout"), 0);
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise resolved"));
console.log("Synchronous code");
```

#### **Output:**

```
Synchronous code
Promise resolved
setTimeout
```

**Why?**

1. **Synchronous code** runs first.
2. **Promise (Microtask Queue) runs before setTimeout (Callback Queue).**

***

## **3. How Node.js Processes Tasks**

#### **Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. Runs **synchronous code** in the **Call Stack**.
2. Sends **async tasks** (file read, API calls) to the **background**.
3. Adds **callbacks** to the **Callback Queue** when complete.
4. **Event Loop** moves tasks from **queues** to the **Call Stack** when empty.

***

## **4. Example: Understanding with a Real-Life Scenario**

Imagine you are **making tea**:

1. **Turn on the stove** (Synchronous Task ‚úÖ).
2. **Boil water** (Async Task, runs in the background üöÄ).
3. **Prepare tea leaves and sugar** (Other synchronous tasks keep running ‚úÖ).
4. **Water boils, beeps** (Event Loop picks callback from queue).
5. **Make tea** (Callback function executes).

***

## **5. Example Code in Node.js**

```javascript
console.log("1: Start Cooking");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("2: Water is Boiling (Async Task)");
}, 3000);

console.log("3: Preparing Bread and Butter");

Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("4: Making Tea with Boiled Water (Microtask)"));

console.log("5: Breakfast is Almost Ready!");
```

***

## **6. Execution Flow of Code**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Synchronous tasks execute first (Call Stack)**

* `"1: Start Cooking"`
* `"3: Preparing Bread and Butter"`
* `"5: Breakfast is Almost Ready!"`

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Microtask Queue executes next (Promises)**

* `"4: Making Tea with Boiled Water (Microtask)"`

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Asynchronous tasks execute last (Callback Queue - setTimeout)**

* `"2: Water is Boiling (Async Task)"` (After 3 seconds)

***

## **7. Final Output Explanation**

```
1: Start Cooking
3: Preparing Bread and Butter
5: Breakfast is Almost Ready!
4: Making Tea with Boiled Water (Microtask)
2: Water is Boiling (Async Task)
```

* **setTimeout() executes last** (because it is in the Callback Queue).
* **Promise executes before setTimeout** (because Microtasks have higher priority).

***

## **8. Key Takeaways**

‚úî Node.js uses non-blocking architecture to handle multiple tasks efficiently.\
‚úî Event Loop ensures the Call Stack is never blocked by moving async tasks.\
‚úî Microtasks (Promises) execute before Callback Queue tasks (setTimeout, API responses).\
‚úî Understanding Call Stack, Event Loop, and Queues is key to writing efficient Node.js applications.
